## Logo

### Components
- **Sign**: Stylized orange keyboard in a rounded rectangle. White keys symbolize the digital environment.
- **Descriptor**: Clarifying text that supplements the brand name. Used to reveal the nature of company activities.
- **Safe Zone**: Imaginary rectangle around the logo. No other design elements allowed within this zone except for a solid brand color background.

### Usage
- The sign can be used independently (e.g., as a favicon or social media avatar) or as part of the brand block.
- Descriptor always placed under the logo, spanning the full width of the logo.
- Fixed interval between logo and descriptor = height of a descriptor letter.
- Icon size matches the height of the text block (from the bottom of the lower button to the top of the upper button).
- Offset from icon to text part = 1.5× width of the letter "I".

### Prohibited Usage
- Changing colors of logo elements.
- Changing relative positions or sizes of elements.
- Deforming or distorting proportions.
- Adding effects, shadows, or strokes.
- Placing on busy backgrounds or non-brand colors.

## Graphic Objects

### Style
- All objects are 3D renders.
- Colors must be within the brand spectrum.
- Glossy plastic, reflective surfaces, partially transparent elements.
- Decorated with technical patterns, barcode-like graphics, and geometric details.

### Rules
- Objects only scale proportionally, never stretch.
- Only one accent per layout.
- Placement always with "air" (breathing room), no text overlaps.
- Positioned in the lower zone, can slightly overflow for dynamics.

### 3D Render Prompt
```
A highly detailed 3D render of [object] floating in zero gravity. The object has glossy plastic with bright reflective surfaces and partially transparent elements, in bold contrasting colors (orange, red, black). Its surface is decorated with subtle technical patterns, barcode-like graphics, and minimalistic geometric details, giving it a futuristic industrial look. Surrounded by glowing light accents, luminous highlights, and dynamic reflections that emphasize its form. Isolated on a dark seamless background with cinematic studio lighting, smooth reflections, and ultra-realistic textures. Minimal, bold, hyper-detailed aesthetic.
```
