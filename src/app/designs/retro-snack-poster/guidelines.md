# Retro Snack Poster

A loud, hand-printed system for street food specials. Big blocks, chunky outlines, and playful doodles that feel like a weekend market flyer.

## Color Rules

- **Never use orange-blue gradients** — this combination clashes with the warm, nostalgic retro aesthetic
- Prefer warm gradient combinations: red-orange, orange-mustard, or single solid colors
- Keep gradients within the same temperature family (warm with warm)

## Typography

- Use **Bebas Neue** for headlines and display text
- Use **Rubik** for body copy and UI elements
- Headlines should be uppercase with tight letter-spacing

## Visual Style

- Chunky 2-3px solid borders with ink black color
- Offset box shadows (4-6px) for depth
- Dashed borders for secondary/outline elements
- Rounded corners (10-24px radius)
- Hand-printed, market poster aesthetic
