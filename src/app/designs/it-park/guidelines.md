## Logo

### Structure
- **Graphic Element**: Stylized orange keyboard in a rounded rectangle
- **White keys** inside symbolize the digital environment
- The keyboard remains the central element, but with a modern, expressive form

### Logo Icon
- Icon size matches the height of the text block (from bottom of lower button to top of upper button)
- Spacing from icon to text = 1.5× width of letter "I"

### Descriptor
- A clarifying inscription that explains or supplements the brand name
- Always positioned under the logo, full width of the logo
- Fixed spacing between logo and descriptor = height of descriptor letter

### Safe Zone
- Imaginary rectangle around the entire logo construction
- No other design elements allowed within this zone
- Only solid backgrounds in approved brand colors

### Icon Usage
- Used as favicon and social media avatars
- Can be used independently or as part of the brand block

### Prohibited Usage
- Do not change colors of logo elements
- Do not change position or size of elements relative to each other
- Do not deform or distort proportions
- Do not add effects, shadows, or strokes
- Do not place on busy backgrounds or non-brand colors

- All other rules same as light backgrounds

### Optional Elements
- Top and bottom capsules can be omitted if they don't add meaning

## Graphic Objects (3D Renders)

### General Style
- All objects rendered in 3D
- Colors always within brand spectrum
- Glossy plastic with bright reflective surfaces
- Partially transparent elements
- Bold contrasting colors (orange, red, black)
- Subtle technical patterns, barcode-like graphics
- Minimalistic geometric details
- Futuristic industrial look

### Scaling Rules
- Objects don't stretch — only scale proportionally

### Layout Usage
- Object should relate to content meaning
- No more than one accent per layout
- Placement always with "air" (breathing room)
- No overlays on text

### Positioning
- Place in lower zone of container
- Can slightly extend beyond upper edge of container for dynamics
- Container can be omitted for cleaner layouts
- Prohibited: Breaking apart heading and subheading with object
- Prohibited: Placing object beyond layout safe zone (exception: horizontal layouts)
- Allowed: Switching positions (graphic on top, text below)

### 3D Render Prompt Template
```
A highly detailed 3D render of [object] floating in zero gravity.
The object has glossy plastic with bright reflective surfaces and
partially transparent elements, in bold contrasting colors (orange,
red, black). Its surface is decorated with subtle technical patterns,
barcode-like graphics, and minimalistic geometric details, giving it
a futuristic industrial look. Surrounded by glowing light accents,
luminous highlights, and dynamic reflections that emphasize its form.
Isolated on a dark seamless background with cinematic studio lighting,
smooth reflections, and ultra-realistic textures. Minimal, bold,
hyper-detailed aesthetic.
```

## Grid System

### Base Format
All layouts developed in square (1:1) as the base for all other formats.

### Prohibited
- Moving or rearranging heading, object, or containers for adaptation
- Changing element scale
- Creating separate independent versions

### Grid Parameters

#### Format 3:4 (900×1200 px)
- Edge padding: 70px
- Column gutter: 20px
- Even vertical columns + 1 row for height padding

#### Format 1:1 (Square)
- Grid structure preserved by adding fields on sides
- Element proportions not disrupted

#### Format 9:16 (1080×1920 px)
- Edge padding: 70px
- Column gutter: 20px

**Minimal information**: Elements centered
**Maximum information**: Elements distributed across full height, anchored to top and bottom grid boundaries
**Combined cases**: Accent shift to upper third allowed

#### Format 16:9 (1920×1080 px)
- Edge padding: 70px
- Column gutter: 20px

## Photo Usage

### Form & Style
- Photos always placed in containers with rounded corners
- Same radius for all elements on layout

### Alignment & Grid
- Strict column alignment, no arbitrary shifting
- Container never extends beyond safe zone
