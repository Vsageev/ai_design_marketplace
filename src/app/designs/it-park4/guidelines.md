# IT Park 4 Brand Guidelines

Modern tech education design system focused on clean layouts, clear hierarchy, and a vibrant brand palette with faceted glass textures.

---

## Philosophy

- Informative layouts stay calm, light, and structured.
- Marketing layouts are bold, colorful, and centered.
- One strong visual accent per layout, always with breathing room.

---

## Logo

### Structure
- **Sign**: Stylized orange keyboard in a rounded rectangle.
- **Keys**: White keys represent the digital environment.
- The keyboard remains the central image; its form is modern and expressive.

### Descriptor
- Clarifies the brand name and explains the company activity.
- Always placed under the logo, spanning the full width of the logo.
- Fixed gap between logo and descriptor = height of a descriptor letter.

### Icon Sizing
- Icon height matches the height of the text block.
- Icon-to-text spacing = 1.5× width of the letter "I".

### Safe Zone
- Imaginary rectangle around the entire logo.
- No other elements allowed inside the safe zone.
- Only solid backgrounds in approved brand colors.

### Usage
- The sign may be used independently (favicon, social avatars) or within the brand block.

### Prohibited Usage
- Do not change the color of logo elements.
- Do not alter relative sizes or positions.
- Do not deform or distort proportions.
- Do not add effects, shadows, or strokes.
- Do not place on busy or non-brand backgrounds.

```
A highly detailed 3D render of [object] floating in zero gravity. The object has glossy plastic with bright reflective surfaces and partially transparent elements, in bold contrasting colors (orange, red, black). Its surface is decorated with subtle technical patterns, barcode-like graphics, and minimalistic geometric details, giving it a futuristic industrial look. Surrounded by glowing light accents, luminous highlights, and dynamic reflections that emphasize its form. Isolated on a dark seamless background with cinematic studio lighting, smooth reflections, and ultra-realistic textures. Minimal, bold, hyper-detailed aesthetic.
