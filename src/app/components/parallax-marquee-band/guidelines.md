# Parallax Marquee Band

## Purpose
A marquee band with layered parallax for a kinetic, premium feel.

## Usage
- Use between sections as a momentum break.
- Keep marquee content short and repeated for continuity.
- Parallax layers should be subtle to avoid dizziness.

## Accessibility
- Pause animation when `prefers-reduced-motion` is enabled.
- Avoid flashing or rapid direction changes.

## Customization
- Change `--marquee-speed` to control scroll pace.
- Update the `data-layer` speeds for parallax depth.
