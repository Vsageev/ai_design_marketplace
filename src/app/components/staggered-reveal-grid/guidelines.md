# Staggered Reveal Grid

## Purpose
Intersection-aware grid that reveals items with staggered motion.

## Usage
- Best for long lists, feature grids, and dashboards.
- Trigger reveal once per item for a polished scroll experience.
- Pair with mild scale/blur for extra depth.

## Accessibility
- Turn off motion for `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Do not hide critical content for too long.

## Customization
- Adjust `--stagger-step` for faster or slower cascades.
- Swap the easing curve for a different feel.
