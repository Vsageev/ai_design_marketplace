# Tilt Glass Cards

## Purpose
Hover-responsive glass cards with tilt, glare, and depth.

## Usage
- Use for feature highlights, pricing, or compact data blocks.
- Keep the tilt subtle (6-10deg) to avoid disorientation.
- Disable tilt on touch devices.

## Accessibility
- Provide a non-tilt fallback for reduced motion.
- Ensure contrast remains strong even with glare.

## Customization
- Tune `--glow` and `--card-border` to match the theme.
- Increase `--tilt-depth` for more dramatic movement.
