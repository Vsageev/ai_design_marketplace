# Pulse Ring CTA

## Purpose
A CTA with layered pulse rings and hover-driven acceleration.

## Usage
- Place at the end of sections to pull attention.
- Keep the ring opacity low to prevent visual noise.
- Use short labels to maintain focus.

## Accessibility
- Provide a static state for reduced motion.
- Ensure the CTA remains clickable without animation.

## Customization
- Adjust `--pulse-color` to match brand accent.
- Tune `--pulse-speed` for calmer or more energetic motion.
