# Cursor Aura Panel

## Purpose
Creates a spotlight-style cursor aura that reacts to hoverable tiles and makes the layout feel alive.

## Usage
- Use on hero or feature areas where you want playful, high-impact motion.
- Keep aura size between 180px and 320px to avoid overwhelming content.
- Pair with subtle hover elevation on tiles for depth.

## Accessibility
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` by disabling cursor tracking.
- Ensure key content is readable without the aura.

## Customization
- Adjust `--aura-color` and `--panel-bg` to match your brand.
- Set `data-aura-active="false"` to freeze the aura for static displays.
