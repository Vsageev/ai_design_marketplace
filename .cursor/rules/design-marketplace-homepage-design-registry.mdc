# Homepage: registering a design

The homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`) manually builds the `designs` array from each design’s `preview.tsx`.

To add a new design:

- Import from `./designs/<design-slug>/preview`:
  - `metadata as <Something>Meta`
  - `PreviewComponent as <Something>Preview`
- Add to `designs`:
  - `{ ...<Something>Meta, PreviewComponent: <Something>Preview }`

Conventions:

- `<design-slug>` must match the folder under `src/app/designs/`
- The card links to `/designs/${metadata.id}`
